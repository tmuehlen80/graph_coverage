I want to write another function that accepts the G_map as the map graph and track_lane_ids as an input. Each element of track_lane_ids holds the same amount of timesteps. For each timestep, I want to create a graph that relates each track to each other. 
For that, each track id represents a node. The node holds the opriginal track data object_type= and  category..  An edge of type "following_lead"  from track A to track B is created, if the lane_id of B can be  reached by a lane_id from track A only using "following" edges  by less than 5 steps. This edge should have a counter in the other direction called "leading_vehicle". 
If only 1 edge of type "neighbor" is needed, it should be an edge of type "direct_neighbor_vehicle". If two lane_ids are connected  by a mix of "following" and "neighbor" and uses max 3 steps along a "following" edge   (neighbor edges do not count), it should be an edge of type "neighbor_vehicle".
