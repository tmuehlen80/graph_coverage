\section{Analysing a traffic scene with a graph}

Having defined a graph-based traffic scene representation, we can now analyse the coverage of the system.
Two methodologies are proposed for this purpose:
One is to define archetypes of traffice scenes, and to compare graphs from observed traffic scenes to these archetypes.
The second one is to translate graphs to graph embeddings, and then to compare the embeddings of different sets of traffic scenes.
