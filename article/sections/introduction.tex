\section{Introduction}



In autonomous driving, coverage analysis is a crucial step to ensure the safety and reliability of the system.
In most situations, coverage arguments are collected either per coverage factor, or maybe up to 2 or 3 factor interactions.
See for example \cite{foretellix2019} for an production grade implementation of state of the art coverage analysis.
In contrast to existing approaches, this paper proposes a graph-based framework for coverage analysis.
There are already other graph-based approaches for analysing and representing traffic scenes.
However, these are not specifically focused on coverage analysis.
Hence in this paper, graph based traffic scene representations are utilized for coverage analysis.

This paper is structured as follows: In chapter \ref{chapter:existing_approaches}, existing coverage and analysis approaches are discussed.
The basis for the following chapters is layed in chapter \ref{chapter:defining_a_traffic_scene_graph}. Afterwards, two coverage approaches 
using the traffic scene graphs are discussed in chapter \ref{chapter:create_subgraphs_for_coverage_analysis} and 
chapter \ref{chapter:implementation_of_graph_embeddings_for_traffic_scene_analysis}.
Finally, the developed methods are applied to Carla and Argoverse 2.0 data in chapter \ref{chapter:application} 
followed by a short summary and outlook.
