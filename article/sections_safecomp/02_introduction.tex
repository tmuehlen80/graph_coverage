\section{Introduction}

In autonomous driving, coverage analysis is a crucial step to ensure the safety and reliability of the system.
In most situations, coverage arguments are collected either per coverage factor, or maybe up to 2 or 3 factor interactions.
See for example \cite{foretellix2019} for a production-grade implementation of state-of-the-art coverage analysis.
In contrast to existing approaches, this paper proposes a graph-based framework for coverage analysis.
While graph-based representations of traffic scenes already exist, they have not been specifically designed for this purpose.
This work bridges that gap by utilizing graph-based traffic scene representations explicitly for coverage analysis.

This paper is structured as follows: In chapter \ref{chapter:existing_approaches}, existing coverage approaches are discussed.
The basis for the following chapters is layed in chapter \ref{chapter:defining_a_traffic_scene_graph}. Afterwards, two coverage approaches 
using the traffic scene graphs are discussed in chapter \ref{chapter:create_subgraphs_for_coverage_analysis} and 
chapter \ref{chapter:implementation_of_graph_embeddings_for_traffic_scene_analysis}.
Finally, the developed methods are applied to Carla and Argoverse 2.0 data in chapter \ref{chapter:application} 
followed by a short summary and outlook.
